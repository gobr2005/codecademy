    "In the past few years, I have become more interested in coffee. I have thought about how Q-scores affect the price of coffee. However, a more foundational questions deals with how a coffee will score first before it is priced. Coffee grading comes down to one major cateria, is this smell/taste desireable or not? This is a wild simplication but often time it is what most coffee buyers like myself care about. \n",

    "## Data\n",
